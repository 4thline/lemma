<h1>
    Provides abstraction of citation anchors in XHTML documents.
</h1>

<p>
    The {@link org.fourthline.lemma.anchor.CitationAnchor} class represents a single anchor in
    an XHTML document, it's an adapter that ties into the <code>org.fourthline.common.xhtml.XHTML</code>
    document object model. The most common options of citation anchors are listed in the
    {@link org.fourthline.lemma.anchor.CitationAnchor.OptionKey} enumeration.
</p>

<p>
    The {@link org.fourthline.lemma.anchor.AnchorAddress} class encapsulates parsing and handling of
    the <code>href</code> attribute value of a citation anchor. It is in fact similar to the
    Java <code>URI</code> and <code>URL</code> classes, however, because these are rather dumb
    abstractions, they can't handle URI's that do not use slashes to separate the authority from
    the path. Hence, this had to be written from scratch.
