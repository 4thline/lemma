    <div class="content">

        <p>
            Lemma does not restrict how you write your documentation, that is, it does not
            mandate any particular subset of XHTML elements you have to use exclusively. Any XHTML
            element that is within the XHTML 1.1 specification is good. On the other hand, as this
            chapter will show, there are some best practices you should be aware of.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, certain features of XML itself such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">XInclude</a>
            are not used frequently by most developers but can play an important role in Lemma when
            your documentation grows beyond a few simple Javadoc comments.
